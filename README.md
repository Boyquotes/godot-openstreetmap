# godot-openstreetmap
Rendering 3d scenes from openstreetmap data...

## Restoration steps
- renewing the ca-certificates.crt file
- Updating all gdscripts, using new classname/method conventions
- Updating all shaders, renaming them to .gdshader

## As of now
- **simple demo** is working although unstable
- **vehicle demo** has lots of outdated shader problems, irrelevant to fix
- **third person demo** has character animation problems, irrelevant to fix
